# Electron React Boilerplate
This is project contains a basic setup for an Electron app with React as a headstart.

You can just simply `git clone https://github.com/enverkaradede/electron-react-boilerplace <real_app_name>` and then you're good to go!

This boilerplate is completely cleansed from the React's icons, headers, titles, vitalMonitors, test scripts, etc. It's simply a blank canvas!

<b>PS: Do not forget to replace "Electron React Boilerplate" texts inside the code blocks!</b>
